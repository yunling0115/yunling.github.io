<p><a href="P1.pdf">The Impact of Venture Capital on the Life Cycles of Startups</a></p>

<p>How do venture capitalists (VCs) select startups to fund over multiple rounds? 
To study this question, I develop a dynamic two-sided matching model of VC funding. 
Using a hand-collected database including both VC-funded and non-VC-funded startups, 
I estimate the determinants of investment selection and the effects of post-investment influence jointly 
in a Bayesian framework. The results show that selection depends on startups' quality and VCs' influence 
– VCs may choose to invest in a startup with lower quality if their subsequent impact is large. 
Importantly, previously funded startups are of higher quality and thus are more likely to get additional funding. 
A simulation experiment shows that initial random differences in startups can magnify significantly 
under the joint effects of the selection and influence of VC funding.</p>

<p><a href="P2.pdf">Is Collaborative Activism Effective?</a>, with Jerchern Lin</p>

<p>In this paper, we define collaborative activism (co-activism) as a set of independent activists 
that pursue the same objective and work together to influence corporate decisions. 
Using a hand-collected dataset from 1994 to 2013, we find that co-activism targets underperforming firms, 
and is mostly nonhostile despite its initial attempt to control around 10% of stocks. 
Co-activism succeeds in roughly 80% of the cases through discussions with the management. 
The market responds favorably to co-activism around the date of filing, 
but market expectation tapers off over the subsequent year. Our evidence suggests that co-activism 
aims for short-term gains at the expense of long-term shareholder value, and pressures the companies to
take myopic actions that are harmful in the long run.</p>

<p><a href="P3.pdf">Firm's Incentive for Information Disclosure: The Trade-off between Capital Market and Product Market</a>, with John Bai</p>

<p>We study how firms disclosure decisions are related to their existing financing and production policies. 
We develop a rational expectations model in which a firm trades off the benefits of more precise disclosure 
in reducing its cost of capital against the costs of more precise disclosure in potentially revealing 
confidential information to competitors. Using abnormal return variance and trading volume  
as proxies for disclosure precision, we find correlations consistent with our model. 
We further exploit three quasi-experiments that exogenenously affect three underlying parameters in the 
model and find evidence consistent with our model's predictions. Our model suggests several important 
determinants of firms optimal disclosure policies and we offer directions for future research.</p>

<p><a href="P4.pdf">Value or Bubble? A Decomposition of the Bitcoin Price</a></p>

<p>In this study, I analyze Bitcoin transaction data and build an economic model on Bitcoin traders 
incentives to decompose the Bitcoin price into a utility-driven component, a speculative component, 
and a friction component. The model I build extends the LDA (Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation) model in Machine Learning, 
and I perform a paralleled collapsed Gibbs Sampling method to estimate the realized incentives of each 
individual trader at each time point. For post-estimation analysis, I look into major headline news 
to see which how information or rumor affects the different components of the Bitcoin price. 
The preliminary results show interesting patterns of trading and pricing in the Bitcoin market for the first time.</p>

<p><a href="P5.pdf">Attention Cascades and Delegated Portfolio Management</a></p>

<p>I study mutual funds' investment in attention-grabbing stocks in this paper.
I use the Google SVI (Search Volume Index) as a measure of retail investors' attention on stocks. 
Stocks that have high abnormal SVI are attention-grabbing.
I find that mutual funds that hold more attention-grabbing stocks in aggregate tend to receive more capital inflow. 
As a result, some fund managers are more likely to increase their subsequent holdings of attention-grabbing stocks.
A portfolio based on both retail investors' attention and mutual funds' trading gives an excess holding return of 259 basis points in 40 days.
